## Core concepts
### World and client

The 'world' is the central element of the server that holds the simulation's state, and clients connect to it using the IP address (default: localhost) and port (default: 2000) to interact or modify the simulation.

### Traffic Manager

The Traffic Manager in CARLA Simulator acts as a built-in system that governs vehicles not involved in learning, orchestrating realistic behaviors to emulate urban environments accurately.

### Synchronous and asynchronous mode

In this mode, the client and server operate in lockstep, with the server waiting for the client to process each simulation step before proceeding to the next. This ensures determinism and precise control over the simulation but can lead to slower overall execution.

### Sensors

In CARLA, sensors are vital for vehicles to gather information about their surroundings. These specialized actors, attached to vehicles, capture data such as camera images, radar readings, and lidar scans, aiding in simulation and analysis tasks.

## Project Architecture

![architecure_diagram](architecture_diagram.png)



### Base components of Architecture

**Car Containers (Host-152 to Host-157):**
Each car container runs an instance of `automatic.control.py`, with six distinct containers handling separate cars in the simulation. They're designed for minimal CPU usage and are identified as Host-152 through Host-157 in the architecture

**Web Socket Container (Host-150):**
This container acts as a dedicated communication hub, enabling real-time interactions between the Controller and the Car containers. It uses WebSocket protocol to facilitate bidirectional messaging.

**Controller (Host-151)**
The Controller orchestrates the simulation by setting car locations, fetching data, and issuing commands to the Car containers. It's the administrative center of the simulation, interacting with the cars through the WebSocket container.

**Internet Router (99999/real-world):**
This router represents the gateway for all the containers to connect with the wider internet, allowing data to flow between the CARLA server and the SEED emulator, effectively bridging the simulation with the client machine.

**Traffic Manager(Host -158):**
The Traffic Manager generates both vehicle and pedestrian traffic, creating a comprehensive and lively urban simulation environment.

**CARLA Server:**
 Running remotely, the CARLA server is the simulation engine powered by Unreal Engine, creating high-fidelity visual and physical simulations of driving environments. It connects to the SEED emulator via the internet.
 
 **Client Machine:**
Located elsewhere, this machine serves as the user's point of access to the simulation.

**SEED Emulator Internet Map:**
The SEED Emulator acts like a virtual traffic system, simulating the network that connects all the cars in the simulation. It makes sure that messages and data travel between the cars and the controllers just like they would over real-world internet connections. It's a key part of the setup that lets the cars "talk" to each other and to the main control center.

**CarlaViz Container**:
Although not depicted in the diagram, the CarlaViz container is an integral part of the Docker network. It offers a live visual feed of the simulation, enabling users to graphically track and analyze the movements and interactions of the vehicles within the CARLA Server environment. Its connectivity to the same network ensures seamless integration with the simulation data flow.

### Initialization Flow:
![Intialization](Initialization.png)

This flowchart details the process for a car container to establish a connection to the CARLA simulation world and to the WebSocket container. Initially, the car container sends two separate connection requests: one to the CARLA world and another to the WebSocket container. Both requests are relayed through the Internet Exchange, with the CARLA world request proceeding to the Internet Router and then to the CARLA Server, while the WebSocket request goes directly to the WebSocket Container. If the CARLA Server is running, it accepts the connection and sends a confirmation back to the car container via the Internet Router, establishing a continuous sensory data feed. Conversely, if the WebSocket Container is not running, the connection request is refused. Otherwise, the connection is accepted. Once the car container is successfully connected, it processes the data from the CARLA Server, makes decisions based on that data, and then sends the decisions back to the CARLA Server. Meanwhile, it connects to the webserver, listens on a port, and waits for any instructions from the Controller, completing the initialization process and being ready for interactive simulation.

### Setting a destination Workflow:
![Destination](Destination.png)


The diagram outlines the workflow for setting a destination in a vehicle simulation system. The process begins with the Controller Container, which sends a destination to the WebSocket Container. This request is routed through the Internet Exchange to the WebSocket Container, which checks if the destination is meant for one car or all cars. If it’s for one car, the WebSocket sends the information to that specific car. If it’s for all cars, the WebSocket broadcasts the destination to every car container. Once the correct car or cars receive the request, they set the new destination. As a car reaches the destination, it sends a notification back through the WebSocket Container. Finally, the Controller receives a notification that confirms the car's arrival at the specified location. This workflow ensures that destination commands are accurately communicated and acknowledged within the system.
### Technical Implementation:

--host 192.168.1.100
```
##### Port (--port)
- **Default:** 2000
- **Purpose:** Specifies the TCP port of the host server for connecting to the CARLA server.
- **Usage Example:**
```cmd
--port 2000
```
##### Resolution (--res)
- **Default:** "1280x720"
- **Purpose:** Sets the simulation window resolution, formatted as WIDTHxHEIGHT.
- **Usage Example:**
```cmd
--res 1920x1080
```
##### Synchronous Mode (--sync)
- **Default:** False
- **Purpose:** Enables synchronous mode, ensuring the simulation only advances on command, which is crucial for precise simulations.
- **Usage Example:**
```cmd
--sync
```
##### Actor Filter (--filter)
- **Default:** "vehicle.*"
- **Purpose:** Filters the types of vehicle actors to spawn based on a pattern.
- **Usage Example:**
```cmd
--filter "vehicle.audi.*"
```
##### Actor Generation (--generation)
- **Default:** "2"
- **Purpose:** Restricts vehicle selection to a specific generation, useful for controlling vehicle types in scenarios.
```cmd
--generation "1
```
##### Loop (--loop,-l)
- **Type**: bool
- **Default:** False
- **Purpose:** Enables continuous reassignment of random destinations after reaching each one, for ongoing testing.
- **Usage Example:**
```cmd
--loop
```
##### Agent Type (--agent)
- **Default:** "Behavior"
- **Choices**:"Behavior", "Basic", "Constant"
- **Purpose:** Chooses the type of driving agent to control the vehicle dynamically.
- **Usage Example:**
```cmd
--agent "Constant"
```

##### Agent Behavior (--behavior)
- **Default:** "normal"
- **Choices**:"cautious", "normal", "aggressive"
- **Purpose:** Sets the behavior mode of the agent to adjust driving style according to traffic conditions.
- **Usage Example:**
```cmd
--behavior "aggressive"
```
##### Seed (--seed)
- **Default:** None
- **Purpose:** Sets a seed for random number generation, ensuring scenario repeatability.
- **Usage Example:**
```cmd
--seed 12345
```
##### WebSocket IP (--ws_ip)
- **Default:** "localhost"
- **Purpose:** Specifies the IP address of the WebSocket server for vehicle to controller communications.
- **Usage Example:**
```cmd
--ws_ip "10.0.1.5"
```
##### WebSocket Port (--ws_port)
- **Default:** 6789
- **Purpose:** Specifies the port for the WebSocket server.
- **Usage Example:**
```
--ws_port 6789
```
##### Role Name (--r_name)
- **Default:** "seed_car_1"
- **Purpose:** Assigns a specific role name to the vehicle, useful for identification in scripts or logs.
```cmd
--r_name "seed_car_2"
```
##### Camera Manager (--cam)
- **Default:** "off"
- **Purpose:** Toggles the camera manager on or off, essential for visual monitoring or running in a headless environment.
- **Usage Example:**
```cmd
--cam "on"
```
##### WebSocket Enable (--ws_enable)
- **Default:** "on"
- **Purpose:** Enables or disables WebSocket communication for the vehicle.
- **Usage Example:**
```cmd
--ws_enable "off"
```
