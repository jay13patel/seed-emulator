# CARLA-SEED Co-Drive

The Developer Manual offers detailed insights into project architecture, technical implementation, visualization, and future developments, as well as troubleshooting guidance. 
## What is CARLA Simulator

CARLA Simulator is an open-source platform designed specifically for the development and testing of autonomous driving systems. It uses Unreal Engine, known for its powerful rendering capabilities, to create highly realistic urban environments. This allows researchers and developers to simulate and analyze various scenarios that autonomous vehicles might encounter.

## Key Components of CARLA Simulator

The architecture of CARLA is based on a client-server model.

### CARLA Server/World

In the CARLA Simulator setup, the server handles all the core tasks necessary for the simulation. This includes rendering the sensors, computing the physics to ensure realistic interactions within the simulated world, and updating the state of the world and its various actors. Given the demand for high-quality, realistic outputs, the server ideally runs on a dedicated GPU. This setup is particularly important as it helps in efficiently managing intensive tasks, thereby enhancing the fidelity and responsiveness of the simulation.
### CARLA Client

CARLA clients represent the entities interacting with the simulation environment. These clients can be autonomous vehicles, Python programs, or any other entities controlling the logic of actors within the scene and setting world conditions. Leveraging the CARLA API, available in Python or C++, these clients communicate with the server to influence the simulation.

### Traffic Manager

The Traffic Manager in CARLA Simulator acts as a built-in system that governs vehicles not involved in learning, orchestrating realistic behaviors to emulate urban environments accurately.

### Synchronous and asynchronous mode

In this mode, the client and server operate in lockstep, with the server waiting for the client to process each simulation step before proceeding to the next. This ensures determinism and precise control over the simulation but can lead to slower overall execution.

### Sensors

In CARLA, sensors are vital for vehicles to gather information about their surroundings. These specialized actors, attached to vehicles, capture data such as camera images, radar readings, and lidar scans, aiding in simulation and analysis tasks.
